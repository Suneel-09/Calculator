# Calculator
This project is developed to perform Simple Mathematical Operations like Addition , Subtraction , Multiplication and Division .
The idea behind the development of this project is to check my HTML skills in initial days of learning web development .
It is my first project developed just after learning HTML .
It is developed using only HTML . 
There are many calculators available on internet to perform these operations that my calculator performs because it performs just basic operations .
But as a learner it is very important for me to test my knowledge on some topic after I completed learning it .
So that if there are any obstacles we faced while developing project we can learn them again and if we did well in the project development that can boost our confidence and excitement to learn another topics .
